Hello

I'm not from this world, do you know where I am?


How can I find her?



Okay, thank you!
Welcome

You must be an other world creature.
I suggest you ask the witch for information.

You must collect 5 key items to summon her.
These include: the goblet, helmet, ring, rose and scroll.
You can obtain these by defeating enemies.

Woah!
Where am I? What is this place?
The last thing I remember is borrowing some strange book
from the library.
There seems to be someone there, maybe I can ask them.
-
A slime!
I should defeat it!
-
It looks like the slime dropped something!
Woah, a goblet!
I should check my inventory to see what I got!
-
A skeleton!
I wonder what items it will drop.
-
The skeleton dropped a helmet!
-
That's the third enemy! I should be close to collecting all
the items!
-
The bandit might steal my items, I should fight it.
-
RAT!
-
I should check my inventory.
-
This must be the final boss. With this, I'll be able to
summon the witch!
-
That's the final item! I should be able to use these to
summon the witch!
-
It worked!
